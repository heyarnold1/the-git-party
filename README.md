I thought git might be a good technology to collectively build manifesto. In the UK their seems to be a complete abscence of policy on critical topics. I hope that we can do better. If you like the idea of using git to build a manifesto but have other political beliefs please start you own party. If you aligned with the principals below please feel free to create pull requests.

# Principal
Business leaders have become the most powerful and some of the wealthiest members of our society. Yet with these privileges there is a great lack of responsibility. Far too often they prioritise their own wealth ahead of their responsibility to society in general, their employees, the environment or even their shareholders. They leverage their wealth to lobby government, they build corporate structures that avoid tax and they strongarm everyone else through lawyers.

Globally we face two unprecedented challenges, global warming and artificial intelligence. We cannot continue to operate with a model where our business leaders face no sanction for their greed, lies and negligence.

At the heart of this manifesto is the principle that with power and wealth must come great responsibility. We require a code of ethics that prohibits damage to society and the environment and reform to our legal system so those responsible can be brought to account and penalised.

# Legal Reform
Companies that fail to meet the code of ethics or violate laws relating to AI, the environment, and employee rights will be penalised through a warning system. After three strikes companies will be barred from operating in the UK or if they are a UK company the state can take the company into its own ownership or force administration.

Directors responsible for breaches will be immediately stuck off and face prison time and financial penalties that will be proportional to their remuneration.

Where a director leaves because they failed to meet the ethics code the employer cannot provide any financial compensation for terminating their contract.

Lawyers' code of ethics will also be enforced with financial penalties for breaches. New policies should focus on the post of scandal and the role the Post Office lawyers took in that case.

The income disparity between the highest and lowest paid lawyers (who typically represent members of the public) is eroding individuals' right to legal counsel.  To address this we propose a tax on all legal fees in excess of £100 per hour that will be used to fund legal services.

Remove character statements.  They benefit the wealthy, white, well connected and privileged, as well as the supposedly pious.  They provide very little substance.  Opens the possibility they are used as part of sentencing

More detailed policy from the secret barrister.

#AI
This party desires to make the UK a leader in the development of responsible AI. We also see an opportunity to become a leader in the regulation of technology and will leverage our principles to achieve that.

One challenge in writing AI policy is how to define it in a way that can be measured. We propose the use of neural networks to constitute AI. Their size also provides a proxy for their power and the environmental impact.

To encourage development of AI and bring the best talent to the UK we would remove income tax on employees working in the development of AI or related fields.

We will require any business developing AI to use ML Ops technology that registered each training and evaluation event with appropriate metadata and that aggregated forms of this data be shared with the government. If a business wishes to operate in the UK but develops its AI elsewhere, they must still provide these reports.

All businesses using AI must apply for a licence. This includes businesses that are not directly developing AI but consume services from those that do. This policy should achieve insight into the full supply chain of AI.

Any business publishing content, that is images, video, music or writing must declare that the content was created by AI.

AI may not be used to optimise downstream the oil and gas industry or any other fossil fuel industry. It may not be used by industries that are deemed to have a negative impact on health, e.g. tobacco, gambling.

#Environment

Central to addressing climate change is challenging investment into sustainable industry, rather than looking to replicate historic returns from fossil fuels.

Raise capital gains tax on polluting industries to 75%. Pension investments in polluting industries would no longer be exempt.
Reduce capital gains tax on green industries to 0%

Ban internal flights in the UK, except to Northern Ireland or Scottish isles without land routes to the mainland. Airlines cannot use Northern Ireland to provide indirect routes.

Ban all private jet flights, unless using battery or hydrogen power.

Continued investment in offshore wind and offshore power islands.
Investment in new nuclear technology using either travelling wave type technology that can reuse existing waste fuel, in turn helping clean up some of our existing nuclear waste.

Require all intensive animal farming to capture all animal waste for collection and use in state operated power plants.

All new buildings must install solar on roofs and heat pumps.

Put limits on the water consumption of data centres, forcing them to move to more sustainable sources of cooling.

All schools, prisons, hospitals and government buildings will serve vegan meals.  Starting children on a vegan diet from an early age will help develop long term habits, they are not prevented from eating meat at home

# Health
We need to address the erosion of the NHS. Privately run health care is more expensive and has an insidious effect on the retention of staff in the NHS. Fixing the deliberate degradation of the NHS will be a slow process.  It will require increases in doctor and nurses salaries, to fund this we propose introducing VAT on privately fund health care

Introduce age limit on purchase of fast food.  Fast food in particular fried chicken shops dominate high streets, their low cost product is a direct cause of health issues in our youth.

# Gambling
Gambling addiction destroys lives and targets the poorest in society putting strain on the most vulnerable individuals and also the state.  Both high street bookmakers and online firms will only be able to offer sports book, no casino style games will be permitted.  
Slots machines and non skill games would remain but only in the confines of strongly regulated casinos.
Sports bets will not be allowed unless the outcome of the bet is over 1 hour after the bet has been made.

# Education
End religious schools
Prevent external lobbying of schools from organisations, or groups beyond the local community
More compulsory sport. Rather than tax private schools, they would be required to share their sports facilities, but can reclaim reasonable operating costs, such as cleaning, or for sports equipment.

# Sport
Funding for sport should be measured by a mixture of olympic success and grass roots participation 
More funding for school sport
Tax on TV sports rights to fund school sport

# Local Government
Ambition to centralise certain IT and operational roles across local government to reduce costs and improve performance for customers

# Charities
Charities must declare all funding over £1000
Charities may not act as PR firms or promote political agendas
Charities must be single agenda


# Political funding
All think tanks and lobbyists must make their funding public. Take more policies from taxpayers alliance settlement example

# Fishing
Quota weights should favour small fishing boats which have less environmental impact and promote more jobs
No fishing in protected areas
Limits on nets and methods e.g. dragging

# Anti social tax
Anti social behaviour will be penalised by income tax penalties, or reduction in benefits.  E.g. first littering offence +1%, second offence +3%

# Lords reform
Fixed 10 year terms. Lords, may keep the title but cannot sit for more than one term. Furthermore election to the house of Lords prevents that person standing for a seat in the house of commons.

Return of law lords to the house of lords.

Retain the list of lords provided by government, the opposition, and others, but have a stricter requirements for service to society that must be met to qualify.
